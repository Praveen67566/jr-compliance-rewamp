# Bootstrap instructions

Read this file before making changes in this repository.

## First steps

1. Read `context.md`.
2. Read `theme.md`.
3. If working on frontend, read `explaner_frontend.md`.
4. If working on CMS, read `explainer_cms.md`.
5. If changing production/deployment behavior, read `prod.md`.

## Main rule

Do not change everything. Do not redesign the whole project. Do not change the folder structure unless I clearly ask for it.

Make only the smallest safe change needed for the request.

## Project boundaries

- `frontend/` is the active Next.js app.
- `cms/` is the active Strapi CMS.
- `site/` is a legacy Webflow export and must be treated as read-only.
- Use `site/` only for approved content/media reference.
- Do not import Webflow CSS, JavaScript, classes, or `data-wf-*` markup into the new frontend.

## Frontend rules

- Keep the existing Next.js App Router structure.
- Keep shared layout in `components/site-page-shell.tsx`.
- Keep shared navbar in `components/site-header.tsx`.
- Keep shared footer in `components/site-footer.tsx`.
- Keep page content loading through `lib/content.ts` and `lib/strapi.ts`.
- Keep TypeScript contracts in `lib/types.ts`.
- Keep fallback content in `data/*-fallback.ts`.
- Keep repeated Company Registration routes in `app/corporate/[slug]` with one
  shared Tailwind page component and the fixed typed fallback contract.
- Match the Compliance Network theme from `theme.md`.
- Do not create a new color palette.
- Do not hard-code editor-managed copy in components if it belongs in Strapi/fallback data.

## CMS rules

- Strapi is connected and must be respected.
- Do not expose `STRAPI_API_TOKEN` to the browser.
- Do not rename `STRAPI_API_TOKEN`.
- Do not use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` for CMS secrets.
- Keep Strapi REST population explicit in `frontend/lib/strapi.ts`.
- Do not replace explicit populate paths with `populate=deep`.
- Keep editable content, links, order, SEO, and media in Strapi/fallback data.
- Use the dedicated `company-registration-page` collection for those service
  routes; do not turn it into a generic page builder or dynamic zone.
- If a CMS schema changes, update all related files together:
  - `cms/CONTENT_MODEL.md`
  - CMS schema files
  - `frontend/lib/types.ts`
  - `frontend/lib/strapi.ts`
  - relevant `frontend/data/*-fallback.ts`

## Styling rules

- Follow `theme.md`.
- Use navy, cobalt, electric blue, sky blue, ice blue, and cool white.
- Do not introduce random accent colors.
- Use Tailwind utilities first for layout, spacing, typography, sizing, responsive states, borders, and palette use.
- Keep `frontend/app/globals.css` limited to Tailwind theme tokens, resets, shared primitives, anchor offsets, and reduced-motion behavior.
- Keep only design-specific CSS that Tailwind cannot express clearly (layered blueprint artwork, pseudo-elements, and keyframes) in the stylesheet colocated with its owner. Do not add page-specific selectors back to `globals.css`.
- Keep responsive behavior for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Preserve accessibility: focus states, keyboard behavior, readable contrast, and reduced-motion support.

## Change safety

- Do not refactor unrelated files.
- Do not remove existing user changes.
- Do not run destructive Git commands.
- Do not edit generated folders like `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `.tmp/`, `dist/`, or `build/`.
- Do not commit secrets, local databases, uploads, or `.env` files.

## Validation

After frontend changes, run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

After CMS changes, run:

```bash
cd cms
npm run build
```

If a command cannot be run, clearly explain why.

## How to respond to my prompts

- First understand the existing structure.
- Then make the requested change.
- Keep the work scoped.
- Tell me what files changed.
- Tell me what validation passed or failed.

## Prompt:-

Frontend UI Improvement:-
1. Take the Next Step Towards Success this section should have a background animation moving and not slowly moving a quick moving animation which matches the theme.
2. I want a Good animation also in the Footer Section with the matching theme.
3. And The Header Given In The Image Text Not Showing Correct that also with matching theme.

keep In Mind That This is also connected with Strapi CMS so based on that do the changes don't change the structure follow the theme
